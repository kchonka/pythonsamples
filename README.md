# Python samples

# Game: Tic Tac Toe
To run: `python main.py`

# Question 1: (Math)
Write a function that takes two integers (x and y) and returns a list of numbers between x and y that are divisible by 5 but not by 7.

To run: `python question1.py x y`

# Question 2: (File)
Given a Comma Separated File (csv) and a column number (zero being the left most column) return the sum of all the entries in that column. Assume that all the entries in the CSV are numbers. Assume also that there are no column headers.

To run: `python question2.py path c`

*'input.csv' is used as an example csv file.

# Question 3: (Math)
Write a function that takes two integers (x and b) as inputs and returns a string that represents the number x in base b.
Example 1: if x=5 and b=2 then the function will return "101"
Example 2: if x=5 and b=3 then the function will return "12"

To run: `python question3.py x b`
